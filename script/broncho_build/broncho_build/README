HOW TO:

1. how to config
	the config file located in integration/config

2. how to use
	[release version]
	./integration/integration.sh [version number]
	[daily build]
	./integration/integration.sh
	[help message]
	./integration/integration.sh -h
	[list the available devices and modules]
	./integration/integration.sh -l
	[choose the devices and modules to compile]
	./integration/integration.sh [version number] -d "devices separated by white-space" -m "modules separated by white-space"

	notes: the "clean" modules did not contain in the default modules list, this module just clean some tmp dir in target_out.
	if you intend to clean the tmp output in integration/target_out and out dir, DIY(do it yourself).

3. how to add a new customer and device
	please add the right options in integration/broncho_build/config, it is case insensitive.

	in the vender/*/device/ have following files:
		build_$CPU_TYPE.sh factory_files.txt 
	and something about this platform.

	in the customer/$CUSTOMER/ have following files:
		build_image.sh build_initram.sh 
	and something about this customer


NOTICE:
	you can complie the single module, but the building system do not copy the result to the right place.
	The output result located in $BRONCHO_INTEGRATION_TARGET_PRODUCT dir.

	if you need a clean $BRONCHO_INTEGRATION_TARGET_PRODUCT dir, do clean module yourself. integration -m "clean"
